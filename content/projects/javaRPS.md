## Description

A Java RPS game that uses a UI is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to play the classic game of rock-paper-scissors against each other over a network connection.

The multiplayer version of the game would allow two players to connect to each other's game board through a network. One player would be the host and the other player would be the client.The host player would launch the game and click the "Host Game" button. The game would prompt the player to enter a port number to use for the connection. The player would then wait for the client to connect.

The client player would launch the game and click the "Join Game" button. The game would prompt the player to enter the host player's IP address and port number to connect to the game. The client player would enter the host's IP address and port number and click the "Connect" button.

Once the client has connected to the host, the game board would appear on both players' screens. The game would work the same way as in the single player game, but now both players can select their choice at the same time. When both players have made their choices, the game would determine the winner and display the result on screens. The players can then play another round by selecting their choices again.


To ensure that the game is fair, both players would have access to the same set of options, and the game board and display would be synchronized across both interfaces. The game would also need to handle issues such as latency and disconnections to ensure that the game remains playable even under less than ideal network conditions.

Overall, adding multiplayer functionality to the RPS game would make it a more engaging and interactive experience for players who want to compete against each other. With a few modifications to the user interface and the addition of network code, you can turn the single player game into a fun and challenging multiplayer experience.
