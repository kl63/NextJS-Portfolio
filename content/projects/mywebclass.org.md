## Contributions:

In my experience working on the MyWebClass.org project, I played a dual role as both a project manager and a web developer. As a project manager, I led the team, ensuring that everyone understood their roles and responsibilities, coordinated tasks, monitored progress, and communicated effectively with one another. I found that my project management skills were essential in keeping the project on track and achieving our objectives.

As a web developer, I was responsible for designing and developing the website, ensuring that it was user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional. I used my technical skills to create a platform that would support the website's mission of promoting Agile and Lean principles in education, as well as providing resources and tools for educators to use in their classrooms.

Overall, my experience working on the MyWebClass.org project taught me the importance of both project management and web development skills in achieving project success. By combining my skills in both areas, I was able to contribute to the team and help create a website that supports the advancement of education.
